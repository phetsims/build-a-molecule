Build a Molecule - Model Notes
================
Atoms are bonded using the lewis-dot directional connections. The size of an atom is dependent on its covalent radius. Atoms are bonded together to build molecules. Molecules are limited to the imported PubChem data set for this sim. The bond lengths and atom sizes are unit less.

Some of these molecules have 3D representations. These 3D models are built on data from the molecule's PubChem entry. The Ball and Stick model and Space Filling models utilize these data entries as well. Each molecule in our

The Single Screen focuses on building individual molecules, while the Multiple Screen focuses building a specific amount of the same molecule. Each molecule is assigned a common name. Some names are as common as "water" while others use the IUPAC Nomenclature, "1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-difluoro-butane". Along with a name, the molecule is also assigned its general formula.
